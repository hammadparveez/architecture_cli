Folder Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

Models
Views
Controllers
Utils
Each of these folders serves a specific purpose and helps to keep the code organized and maintainable.

1. Models
The Models folder contains the data models used by the application. These models are used to represent data retrieved from APIs or databases and are typically used by the controllers to manage the application's state.

2. Views
The Views folder contains the UI screens of the application. Each screen is typically associated with a single controller and displays the data managed by that controller.

3. Controllers
The Controllers folder contains the classes that handle the business logic of the application. These classes are responsible for fetching data from repositories, processing data, and updating the state of the application.

4. Utils
The Utils folder contains utility classes and functions that are used throughout the application.
