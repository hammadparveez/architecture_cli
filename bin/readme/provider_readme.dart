Folder Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

Provider
Models
Repository
Services
Screens
Widgets
Utils
Routes
Each of these folders serves a specific purpose and helps to keep the code organized and maintainable.

1. Provider
The Provider folder contains the ChangeNotifier classes that are used for state management in the application. ChangeNotifier is a built-in class in Flutter that provides a way to manage the application's state and notify the UI when the state changes. Each ChangeNotifier is responsible for a specific feature of the application and manages the state for that feature.

2. Models
The Models folder contains the data models used by the application. These models are used to represent data retrieved from APIs or databases and are typically used by the providers to manage the application's state.

3. Repository
The Repository folder contains classes that are responsible for fetching data from APIs or databases. The repositories abstract away the details of how the data is retrieved and provide a clean interface for the providers to use.

4. Services
The Services folder contains classes that handle communication with external services, such as APIs or push notification services.

5. Screens
The Screens folder contains the UI screens of the application. Each screen is typically associated with a single provider and displays the data managed by that provider.

6. Widgets
The Widgets folder contains the UI widgets that are used throughout the application. These widgets are designed to be reusable and can be used in multiple screens.

7. Utils
The Utils folder contains utility classes and functions that are used throughout the application.

8. Routes
The Routes folder contains the application's navigation system. It defines the routes that are available in the application and provides a clean interface for navigating between screens.
