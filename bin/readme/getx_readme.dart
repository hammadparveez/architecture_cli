Folder Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

Bindings
Models
Controllers
Repository
Services
Views
Widgets
Utils
Routes
Each of these folders serves a specific purpose and helps to keep the code organized and maintainable.

1. Bindings
The Bindings folder contains classes that handle dependency injection for the views and controllers. These classes are used to provide instances of services and repositories to the controllers and views that require them.

2. Models
The Models folder contains the data models used by the application. These models are used to represent data retrieved from APIs or databases and are typically used by the controllers and views to manage the application's state.

3. Controllers
The Controllers folder contains the classes that handle the business logic of the application. These classes are responsible for fetching data from repositories, processing data, and updating the state of the application.

4. Repository
The Repository folder contains classes that are responsible for fetching data from APIs or databases. The repositories abstract away the details of how the data is retrieved and provide a clean interface for the controllers to use.

5. Services
The Services folder contains classes that handle communication with external services, such as APIs or push notification services.

6. Views
The Views folder contains the UI screens of the application. Each screen is typically associated with a single controller and displays the data managed by that controller.

7. Widgets
The Widgets folder contains the UI widgets that are used throughout the application. These widgets are designed to be reusable and can be used in multiple views.

8. Utils
The Utils folder contains utility classes and functions that are used throughout the application.

9. Routes
The Routes folder contains the application's navigation system. It defines the routes that are available in the application and provides a clean interface for navigating between views.
