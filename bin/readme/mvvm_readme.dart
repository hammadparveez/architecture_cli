Folder Structure
The project is organized into several folders:

Models
Views
ViewModels
Utils
Services
Each of these folders serves a specific purpose and helps to keep the code organized and maintainable.

1. Models
The Models folder contains the data models used by the application. These models are used to represent data retrieved from APIs or databases and are typically used by the view models to manage the application's state.

2. Views
The Views folder contains the UI screens of the application. Each screen is typically associated with a single view model and displays the data managed by that view model.

3. ViewModels
The ViewModels folder contains the classes that handle the business logic of the application. These classes are responsible for fetching data from repositories, processing data, and updating the state of the application. They also interact with the views to update the UI and respond to user input.

4. Utils
The Utils folder contains utility classes and functions that are used throughout the application.

5. Services
The Services folder contains classes that handle communication with external services, such as APIs or push notification services.
